                Some users may choose to publicly post personally identifying or
                sensitive information about themselves in their normal use of
                our services. This could occur through the use of optional
                profile fields, in interactions on public boards, or if a
                previously private interaction is made public. Information like
                that, which is voluntarily posted in publicly visible parts of
                our platform, is considered to be public, even if it would
                otherwise be considered to be personally identifying or
                sensitive. We may process such information posted by you for the
                performance of a contract between you and us and the legitimate
                interests of ours and/or those of third-parties, namely to
                provide our services, to prevent, detect and investigate fraud,
                criminal activity and/or other misuse of the services and
                compliance with a legal obligation that MetalCharts is subject
                to, namely in order to comply with anti-money laundering and
                anti-terrorist financing laws. Additionally, voluntarily
                publicizing such information means that you lose any privacy
                rights you might normally have with regards to that information.
                It may also increase your chances of receiving unwanted
                communications, like spam.

          trades to either buy or sell commodities are initiated by responding
          with a trade request to advertisements created by other users. With
          the trade request, you are making a legally binding offer and agree to
          be bound by the terms and conditions of the trade (such as exchange
          rate, commodity amount and terms of payment) as determined by the
          advertiser to whom you are sending the trade request to. <br /> When
          sending the trade request, you may need to select from options made
          available in the advertisements or accept any freeform terms and
          conditions set out by the advertiser in the terms of trade field and

          You can create commodities(gold and crude oil) trade advertisements to
          advertise that you want to buy or sell any commodities. Other users
          can send trade requests to you from the advertisements that you’ve
          created. When a trade request is sent to you any commodity trade is
          automatically started. When you have advertisements enabled you are
          required to be active and available to reply to trades started from
          these advertisements. <br /> The price that is defined in the
          advertisement details must contain any fees that the advertiser
          requires the buyer to pay. After initiation of trade, the price is
          locked and cannot be changed or any additional fees added without
          consent from both parties of the trade. Multiple advertisements which
          are fully overlapping (e.g. using the same trade limits with the same
          price in the same payment method category in the same country) are not
          allowed. Limitation, Suspension, and Termination of Your User Account
